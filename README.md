# Where's Waldo Game

A photo tagging game where you indentify popular characters in an image by selecting them. It has sign-in functionality with Google and uses firebase as a backend to store user scores and display them on a leaderboard.

To-Do:

- Add more sign-in providers than Google
- Handle the timer on the backend so it can't be cheated
- Make the help icon actually pop up rules
- Style the tag pop-up to be more visually appealing
- Make the site more responsive to window changes (e.g. tag popup doesn't go offscreen, header re-sizes)
- Add more images to choose from with unique leaderboards
- Have a light mode utiliziing React context
